Johnny's Movie Trailer Website


Overview
--------

This Python program will create a website with my favorite 
Movie Trailer's when you run the media center file in 
Python's IDLE. After the program is run for the first time,
you will find an HTML file in the same folder as the program.
Launching this HTML file in your favorite browser such as
Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer will allow
you to view the website without running the Python program
again.
